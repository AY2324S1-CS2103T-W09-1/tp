### Project: FAPro

FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to keep track of large numbers of 
contacts. It allows FAs to have a one-stop platform to manage their contacts and conduct financial analytics while providing a big-picture view of their clientele as a whole.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a questionnaire window
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the risk assessment multiple choice questions, including the grading and risk profile categories criteria.
    * Justification: The questionnaire window was added to enhance user experience by providing a set of questions which they can refer in knowing their client risk profile level.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is manageable since it is hard-coded. However, the challenging part is to find suitable set of risk assessment questions, that is compatible to my `riskprofile` feature design.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the ability to add client's risk profile level
    * What it does: Generates the client's risk profile level based on their responses to the risk assessment questionnaire provided in the questionnaire window and adds it to their contact.
    * Justification: This feature was implemented to streamline the process of assessing clients' risk profiles by automating the evaluation process. By automating this crucial aspect, it saves user time and effort.
    * Highlights: Since this was my first experience contributing to a brownfield project, it was initially challenging because I needed to get familiar with the existing code base. Nevertheless, the tutorial and the individual tasks that I had completed do help me quickly adapt in implementing this feature.
