### Project: FAPro

FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to keep track of large numbers of 
contacts. It allows FAs to have a one-stop platform to manage their contacts and conduct financial analytics while providing a big-picture view of their clientele as a whole.
