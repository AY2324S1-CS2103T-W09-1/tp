### Project: FAPro

FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to keep track of large numbers of contacts. It allows FAs to have a one-stop platform to manage their contacts and conduct financial analytics while providing a big-picture view of their clientele as a whole.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Parameter**: Added Appointment Date parameter
  * What it does: Allows the store of appointment date of a client
  * Justification: Users may wish to store the Appointment Date of their clients, to remind them of their next appointment with their client 
  * Highlights: As the value inputted is in String datatype, creating a date parser can be hard as there are many ways to format the date without creating bugs. Overall, a proper planning should have been done before going straight to coding. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort contacts
  * What it does: Allows the user to sort the contact list by Name or Appointment Date parameter.
  * Justification: Users may wish to have an organized contact lists to find the contacts easily or to find the earliest appointment date to remind them of their next appointment.
  * Highlights: Slightly difficult as the list is saved in an immutable list. Circumvented by returning a new sorted list each time the function is called. Overall,  manageable to implement.
