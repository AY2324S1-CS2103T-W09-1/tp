**FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to keep track of large numbers of contacts**. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

## Problem Addressed
* A lot of contacts
* Hard to track which clients have existing products and which products
* Possibly volatile contacts as need to keep up with them over long periods of time
* Do analytics
* Provides them with an overview of all possible clients (big-picture)
